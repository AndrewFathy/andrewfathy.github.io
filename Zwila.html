						Zwila is a 3rd-person game set in Egypt in 1808 at the very end of the Mamluk dynasty. At the time the Khediv “Muhammad Ali” ruled Egypt under the Ottoman empire. The Mamluks were always trying to take Muhammad Ali’s place as rulers of Egypt, they even used magic and chemistry, subjects they excelled in. When the Ottomon empire ordered the Khediv Muhammad Ali to send an army to fight the war, Muhammad Ali was worried that with most of his allies outside the country, the Mamluks would assassinate him. So, he arranged a feast to celebrate the army and used the opportunity to poison all the Mamluk leaders. Our story follows a young Mamlouk chemist as he attempts to escape the city and Muhammad Ali’s soldiers using his wits and his knowledge of chemistry.
